// * main game loop

// * Set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards
// TODO populate each gameboard with predetermined coordinates
// ? leave placing player's coordinates for later

// TODO take dominteraction methods and display gameboards

// TODO take turns using methods from other objects

// ?If at any point you are tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to.

// TODO Create conditions so that the game ends once one players' ships have all been sunk

// *There are several options available for letting users place their ships. You can let them type coordinates for each ship, or investigate implementing drag and drop.

// *You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.

// *Optionally, create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth. If you’re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each others boards!
